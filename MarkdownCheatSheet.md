## Lists
### Ordered List
The list should start with one but the order doesn't matter. Makes rearranging very easy.
```
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
    1. First nested item
    2. Second nested item
```
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
    1. First nested item
    2. Second nested item

### Unoredered List
Unordered lists can start with a -, *, or +. Just be consistant.
```
- First item
- Second item
- Third item
    - First nested item
    - Second nested item
```
- First item
- Second item
- Third item
    - First nested item
    - Second nested item

### Code Blocks
Surround your code with \`\`\`. Type your codes language right after the the beginning \`\`\`  to get proper highlighting.
```
```python
text = "Hello World!"
print(text)```
```  


```python
text = "Hello World!"
print(text)
